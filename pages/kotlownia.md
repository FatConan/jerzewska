Interior revitalisation of an old boiler building. This was a new concept to repurpose an old factory as an art gallery, cafe, and a space for social gatherings and other events. The design included 3D visuals and a catalog and was created for my final exam at Promocja College. My main inspiration were the original brick walls. I used yellow to add some vibrancy to punctuate the mellow tones. Catalog design was kept deliberately simple as not to distract from the presented interior visuals and products.
