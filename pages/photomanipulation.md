#Photo Manipulation
This is a selection of photo-manipulations created using Photoshop; my Photoshop skills are self taught. 
While many of them are only creative endeavours, some were also parts of a [commercial project](/portfolio/waterbysun.html) encapsulating their processes
in striking visuals.

My approach to photo-manipulation often involves playing with shadows and light, creating convincing scenes with a hyper-real look.
