#Eco-tour
Re-designed branding for the dynamic, eco-friendly travel agency “Eco-Tour” based in Wroclaw. 

The idea was to create a fresh and simple look associated with nature. My inspiration came from the landscapes of their destinations; that’s why I decided to include the movement of waves, the peaks of hills and animal symbols. For printing, as the company is eco-friendly, I decided to go with recycled paper.
