#Logos
A collection of logos designed for a wide range of clients. 
I enjoy developing this most recognisable part of branding. 
I strive for clear communication with the client to gain a deep understanding of their needs. 
I find developing ideas from sketches through multiple variations to a final design is extremely rewarding. 
Iâ€™m always trying to find unique and individual shapes that crystallise the client's vision for their product.
