#Water By Sun branding
Branding made for a Danish water pump company developing a solar driven water pump intended for the African market. This project was a real world assignment as a part of my studies at UCN. The idea was to express the technical process of extracting water - using power harnessed from the sun - in a simple understandable way. My inspirations were the process and the habitats of the continent of Africa.
