Visual identity designed for an enterprise offering hand painted custom fabrics, as a part of my mid-term project at UCN. 
I wanted to focus on the hand-made aspect so I decided to use custom typography made with brush strokes as well as paint splatter. 
Tags and packaging include printed graphics from the project.
