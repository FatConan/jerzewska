Branding designed for Elektrobudowa for the XXVII international fair of energy Energetab 2014. 
Design includes invitation, bags, flashdrive, magazine spread, huge exterior banner and retouched photo set. 
I used colours consistent with the company branding. The main graphic idea was to reflect their strong direction as their slogan is “powering the future”. 
I also created a collection of large dramatic photographic manipulations as a part of their showcase.
