#Web-designs
Here is a selection of sites I’ve designed over the years. This gallery includes layouts for various clients.
I started as a self taught web designer with a knowledge of Photoshop and HTML. 
I have developed my skills over time through education and self improvement. 
I carefully consider all aspects of web design including structure, graphics and typography.
I always pay great attention to brand materials and consistency.
