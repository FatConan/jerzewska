#Photography
Pictures were taken in the studio during my photography course while studying at Promocja College.
Additionally I have taken courses in composition, working with artificial lighting and post production.

I my free time I enjoy macro and landscape photography, as well as snapping the occasional shot of my culinary efforts and my pets for Instagram.
