Oodls is a Scottish startup that provides stock images providing opportunities to
sell and buy through Instagram accounts.

While working for another company I was sharing an office with them. We ended
up collaborating on some projects. I ended up helping them with a re-brand and
couple of email templates for them.

## The brief:

* Minimalistic logo, showing stock photography.
* Including Word mark and symbol/icon available for the app, software and social
* media
“oodles of photos”
{maybe?

## Inspirations:

## Research:

First step was to check out the competition and see what’s out there on the
market. Most of the well known companies providing stock images use very
simplistic word marks with slight minimalistic shape included. Which was exactly
what the customer wanted and included in their brief.

## The Idea:

The name of the company came from the word Oodles, which means a large
quantity. First idea that popped into my head was infinity sign that symbolises,
well.. number of infinite things, which is a great combination with the company
name. As they are providing stock images I though incorporation of a camera
symbol would be a great fit.

There was a lot of variation I was playing around, with the camera shape, shutter
symbol, content of the camera. I was looking for a very small yet very distinctive
element that would strike out.

<div class="examples">
    <img src="" />
</div>

There is one of them that stands out the most for me. It included the infinity
symbol, camera element, and double line that indicated both ways od the
business, providing stock photography for everyone and business opportunity for 
instagrammers. It also worked the best as a symbol. It was a combination of the
infinity sign, and a camera icon - which is used in instagram app logo as well.
In the end I decided to show in my first presentation this iteration of the logo.

<div class="reveal">
    <img src="" />
</div>

## The problem

Turns out the idea was great, but the double line was not very visible when scaled
and tested with a group of people. They couldn’t tell the name of the company in
smaller size, which was obviously quite big of an issue. The customer liked the
shape and the idea behind it so I decided to simplify the logo even more and
ditch the idea of the double line for the legibility.

Another iteration that was tested:

This version was a much improved, but there has still been an issue. It was read
either “oools” or “oods”. A new issue also showed up. As a stock image company
they need to use their logo as a word mark. Turned out that single line logo is not
very visible and easy to remove from the image.

## Final result

In the end I decided to make the logo much thicker as we planned from the
original. This way the watermark on the photos will be easily visible and not so
easy to be removed. Logo looked more legible and stable.

## Additionally:

Later in a year I collaborated with them again on a couple of email templates.
Since they emails are focusing more on the photography I decided to keep it very
minimalistic, and similar to their website.
At the email footer I included the section of their most popular collections.
