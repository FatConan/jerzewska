Strzelec Wrocław is a collective group of people from Wroclaw and the surrounding area 
interested in recreational activities involving proficiency tests of accuracy, precision and speed in shooting, 
of using various types of weapons.

(It’s legal in Poland to shoot at the shooting range - every adult and children can shoot 
in the presence of a legal guardian)

## The brief:

* Friendly logo
* Showing recreational shooting.
* Simple enough to print embroidery(?!) on round morale patch

## The History & Idea:

Before we begin with the process, I would like to tell you a bit more about this project as it’s one of my favourites. 
Mostly because of the history, process, idea and overall experience. 

Project started pretty basic. I designed couple of logos variations which were very simple, but they they were not speciall.

<div class="graphic-auto">
    <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/shooting/shooting-logo1.png" alt="The original logo based around the cylinder of a revolver."/>
</div>

The customer didn’t really have any ideas what he wanted so he went a little bit soul searching. He came up with the 
idea to incorporate Gnomes in the project. Sounds weird, but there is a bit of history behind it. One of Wrocław’s 
most memorable and funkiest attractions are Gnomes. There are couple of stories and tales how it started. The historic 
one is talking about Orange Alternative movement, I personally prefer more version about gnomes fighting the goblin :)

## Inspirations:

<div class="graphic wide">
    <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/shooting/shooting-inspi.png"
     alt="A collection of images of gnomes and gnome like creatures from various folklore and artists."/>
</div>

## Research:

Research included finding different type of guns and gnomes shape. I was trying to find some style the client would 
like. Would it be linear, flat or cartoonish type of illustration. Client was very much inclined to use a shape 
of an old retro pistol.

## The Idea:

At this point the idea was very clear, I wanted to incorporate the vision of the gnome, holding retro 
pistols. I was inspired by the story of gnomes fighting the gobiln, so I decided to gave him angry facial 
expression. In a developed version of the illustration I have gim Orange hat as a nod to the historical value.

    <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/shooting/shooting-logo2.png" 
    alt="The idea for the for the new logo based on a classic revolver and the gnomish image." />
</div>

## The problem:

<div class="graphic additional shooting-problem">
    <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/shooting/shooting-logo3.png" 
    alt="A close up of the problematic finger placement on the trigger of the revolver within the logo."/>
</div>

Customer loved the logo, but there was one big issue he had with it. Anyone who hold guns like 
this should never have a finger on the trigger. 

He also wasn’t a fan of the orange hat. He also wanted to see how it would look like inside 
the circle for the morale patch.

## Final result:

I’ve adjusted the shape to be round, removed the fingers from the trigger and decided to go more with the
tactical hat pattern on the illustration.
