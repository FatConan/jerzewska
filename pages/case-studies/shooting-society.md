Strzelec Wrocław is a collective group of people from Wroclaw and the
surrounding area interested in recreational activities involving proficiency tests of
accuracy, precision and speed in shooting, of using various types of weapons.
(It’s legal in Poland to shoot at the shooting range - every adult and children can
shoot in the presence of a legal guardian) 

## The brief:

Friendly logo showing recreational shooting.
Must be simple enough to print embroidery(?!) on round morale patch

## The History

Before we begin with the process, I would like to tell you a bit more about this
project as it’s one of my favourites. Mostly because of the history, process, idea
and overall experience.

Project started pretty basic. I designed couple of logos which were not great.

The customer didn’t really have any ideas what he wanted so he went a little bit
soul searching. He came up with the idea to incorporate Gnomes in the project.
Sounds weird, but there is a bit of history behind it. One of Wrocław’s most
memorable and funkiest attractions are Gnomes. There are couple of stories and
tales how it started. The historic one is talking about Orange Alternative
movement, I personally prefer more version about gnomes fighting the goblin :)
{maybe?

## Inspirations:

## Research:

Research included finding different type of guns and gnomes shape. I was trying
to find some style the client would like. Would it be linear, flat or cartoonish type
of illustration. Client was very much inclined to use a shape of an old retro pistol.

## The Idea:

At this point the idea was very clear, I wanted to incorporate the vision of the
gnome, holding retro pistols. I was inspired by the story of gnomes fighting the
gobiln, so I decided to gave him angry facial expression. In a developed version of
the illustration I have gim Orange hat as a nod to the historical value.

## The problem

Customer loved the logo, but there was one big issue he had with it. Anyone who
hold guns like this should never have a finger on the trigger. He also wasn’t a fan
of the orange hat. He also wanted to see how it would look like inside the circle
for the morale patch.

## Final result 

I’ve adjusted the shape to be round, removed the fingers from the trigger and
decided to go more with the tactical hat pattern on the illustration.
