MY.BX is a part of the BLACKBX company software. BLACKBX (now Stampede) is
a SaaS software company providing customer insights and effective digital
marketing automation tools through data collection from Wifi. MY.BX is a
platform platform for end user customers to have insight of how their data is
used according to the GDPR rules with the possibility of turning it off and on.

## The brief: 

Improving existing platform.

## Research:

First step was to understand how existing platform is working. Understand how
it’s used, what are the main features people are interested in and which device
they use it the most. The company is using Full Story to see user’s behaviours.

## The problem

The first problem was a lack of overview, and overall lack of responsiveness for the
mobile version.

## The process:

I wanted to bring back dashboard overview so the user can see straight away 4
main control points. Personal infos available for everyone to see and use for
marketing purposes. Connections, which places user was connected through
overall. Devices which user has registered on the platform. Payments, if he paid in
any places for the wifi. Each card then would show more in depth options
available.

The most important thing was to focus on the mobile version as it was used the
most by the users. I decided to build the wireframe on the tiles, for easy
responsiveness. Since we were talking about the people visiting places, I though
using the list with places names is nut sufficient enough. A lot of people don’t
remember places they go to, yet they usually remember logos and branding very
easily. It was possible to import logos of the companies that collected data to the
platform.

Connections was one of the most important section as it’s a panel control for th
data collection. Toggle on/off and search field were the most essential elements.
For instance, if someone got promotional email from one place, and didn’t wish
to get any more emails from them, they could easily search the company name,
and just switched toggle off, and that’s it.

## Final result

Platform is now easier to use and more clear and readable comparing to the
previous version. Using tiles solved the problem of the responsiveness on different
devices, as well as recognising different places and be more visible for detailed
data.

My experience shows people struggle with data. It’s very important not to
overwhelm and scare them with unnecessary numbers.

## Update:

Navigation could be improved as mobile version uses only burger icon. Since
more phones are now above 5’’ it’s quite hard to navigate burger icons with one 
hand. I would like to add a bottom navigation using 4 main + home sections.
Export and sign out icon could be placed at the top.
