MY.BX is a part of the BLACK**BX** company software. BLACKBX (now Stampede) is a SaaS 
software company providing customer insights and effective digital marketing 
automation tools through data collection from Wifi. MY.BX is a platform platform
for end user customers to have insight of how their data is used according to the GDPR 
rules with the possibility of turning it off and on. 

## The brief: 

* Improving existing platform.

## Previous design:

## Problem 1:

* lack of overview
* not responsive
* lack of easy navigation
* bland, not modern design

## Research:

First step was to understand how existing platform is working. Understand how it’s used, what are the main features people 
are interested in and which device they use it the most. The company is using Full Story to see user’s behaviours.

## The idea:

I wanted to bring back dashboard overview so the user can see straight away 4 main control points. Personal infos 
available for everyone to see and use for marketing purposes. Connections, which places user was connected through 
overall. Devices which user has registered on the platform. Payments, if he paid in any places for the wifi. Each card 
then would show more in depth options available.

The most important thing was to focus on the mobile version as it was used the most by the users. I decided to build
the wireframe on the tiles, for easy responsiveness. Since we were talking about the people visiting places, 
I though using the list with places names is nut sufficient enough. A lot of people don’t remember places they go to, 
yet they usually remember logos and branding very easily. It was possible to import logos of the companies that 
collected data to the platform. 

Connections was one of the most important section as it’s a panel control for th data collection. Toggle on/off and 
search field were the most essential elements.
For instance, if someone got promotional email from one place, and didn’t wish to get any more emails from them, 
they could easily search the company name, and just switched toggle off, and that’s it.

## Problem 2

* Nav is not mobile friendly.

Since more phones are now above 5’’ it’s quite hard to navigate burger icons with one hand.

## Final result:
Platform is now easier to use, more clear and readable comparing to the previous version. Using tiles solved the 
problem of the responsiveness on different devices, as well as recognising different places and be more visible for 
detailed data. Bottom navigation helps with jumping through the whole platform.
My experience shows people struggle with data. It’s very important not to overwhelm and scare them with unnecessary 
numbers.
