BLACK**BX** (now Stampede) is a software as a service (SaaS) company providing customer insights 
and effective digital marketing automation tools through data collection from their public Wifi offering.

## The brief:

* Improving existing software
* Better data overview
* Creating new features
* UI design system

## Previous software design:

    <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/dashboard/dash-previous.png" alt="Screenshot of the original version of the system."/>
    <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/dashboard/dash-gif.png" alt="Animation showing the old version of the system in action." />
</div>

## General Problems:

* lack of dashboard overview
* difficult navigation
* messy nav (3 different setups in 3 different places)
* design not suitable for extensive data, or for accommodating new feature development
* sidebar nav was changing confusingly as the user navigated the site

## Research:

The first step was to understand how the existing platform worked for its users. Understanding how it was being used, 
which were the main features people were interested in, and which devices they use it on the most. 
The company is using Full Story to see user’s behaviours.

* lot of research comes in between looking for different solutions - for example, double nav etc
* solution inspirations that could work for us

</div>

## Process:

* main dashboard overview + showing extra addons and their value

<div class="graphic standard split" style="grid-template-columns: 526px 195px; grid-gap: 20px;">
    <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/dashboard/dash-1.png"

    alt="An example of a new attention grabbing section showing the add-ons customer's may pay for to enhance their account's abilities."/>
</div>

* Bringing back side nav (from an older version)

    alt="A mock-up showing the reintegration of an older navigation system with sections linked across the top of the screen and sub-sections linked in a menu on the left hand side."/>
</div>

## Problem 1:

* too long, complicated, confusing and distracting process
* instead, we did 3 tabs steps to show less. It didn’t look so difficult and we didn’t ask 
more then 3 very simple questions to avoid confusion.

</div>

## Problem 2:

* Filters

Filter panel started to get too long with too many options to be constantly visible. I decided to add a sliding panel 
on the right so it doesn’t take up all the necessary space for data.

    <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/dashboard/dash-gif2.png" 
    alt="An animation showing the new slide-in data filtering menu."/>
</div>

## Problem 3:

* One of the setup problems (general problem) belong to the data capture

I decided to make the whole branding panel in one, 
with a generic preview on the right hand side with a variety of devices.

    alt="Screenshot of the branding preview window allowing customers to preview their landing page on a variety of devices."/>
</div>

## Problem 4:

* User overview

The easiest option was to created the 
timeline showing end-user locations which they can chose to block them or idk.. :D

<div class="graphic standard">
    <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/dashboard/dash-9.png" 
    alt="Screenshot of the new user management system."/>
</div>

## On boarding:

* so the users can get up to speed with the new design quicker. 

This lets them reach higher productivity levels much faster than if they had to figure everything out on their own

<div class="graphic standard">
    <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/dashboard/dash-gif3.png" 
    alt="Screenshot showing the new introduction to the on-boarding system to get customers up to speed with the new interfaces."/>
</div>

## Cancellation survey:

<div class="graphic additional">
     <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/dashboard/dash-10.png" 
    alt="Screenshot of the new off-boarding survey designed to capture departing customer's thoughts so they can be channeled into design improvements and new feature sets." />
</div>

* since we had very limited research and data, we started doing something in this area :D
* we introduced cancellation survey - helped us identify the problem, also give a range of 
solution for the CS team how to approach the customer, saved us some churn.

</div>

## Update:

At the moment we’re conducting customer interviews and user testing this design - because of 
the time pressure we had to wait with this until after the new release. There is still 
lots to be improved, and few new features to be developed. Product design is a constant 
improvement for the user.
