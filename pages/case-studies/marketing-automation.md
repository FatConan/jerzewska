BLACK**BX** (now Stampede) is a SaaS software company providing customer insights 
and effective digital marketing automation tools through data collection from Wifi.

## The brief:

* Improving existing software
* Better data overview
* Creating new features
* UI design system

## Previous software design:

</div>

## General Problems:

* lack of dashboard overview
* difficult navigation
* messy nav (3 different setups in 3 different places)
* design not suitable for extensive data, or for accommodating new feature development
* sidebar nav was changing confusingly as the user navigated the site

## Research:

The first step was to understand how the existing platform worked for its users. Understanding how it was being used, 
which were the main features people were interested in, and which devices they use it on the most. 
The company is using Full Story to see user’s behaviours.

* lot of research comes in between looking for different solutions - for example, double nav etc
* solution inspirations that could work for us

## Process

* main dashboard overview + showing extra addons and their value

* Bringing back side nav (from the older version)

</div>

## Problem 1:

* too long, complicated, confusing and distracting process
* instead, we did 3 tabs steps to show less. It didn’t look so difficult and we didn’t ask 
more then 3 very simple questions to avoid confusion.

</div>

## Problem 2:

* Filters

Filter panel started to get too long with too many options to be constantly visible. I decided to add a sliding panel 
on the right so it doesn’t take up all the necessary space for data.

</div>

## Problem 3:

* One of the setup problems (general problem) belong to the data capture

I decided to make the whole branding panel in one, 
with a generic preview on the right hand side with a variety of devices.

</div>


## Problem 4:

* User overview

The easiest option was to created the 
timeline showing end-user locations which they can chose to block them or idk.. :D

## On boarding:

* so the users can get up to speed with the new design quicker. 

This lets them reach higher productivity levels much faster than if they had to figure everything out on their own

## Cancellation survey:

<div class="additional">
     <img src="/resources/img/case-studies/pages/dashboard/dash-10.png" 
    alt="An animation showing the scrolling of the Oodls email template that shows off a selection of Instagram stock photograph." />
</div>

* since we had very limited research and data, we started doing something in this area :D
* we introduced cancellation survey - helped us identify the problem, also give a range of 
solution for the CS team how to approach the customer, saved us some churn.

## Update:

At the moment we’re conducting customer interviews and user testing this design - because of 
the time pressure we had to wait with this until the new release. There is still 
lots to be improved and few new features to be developed. Product design is a constant 
improvement for the user.
