## The brief:

* Logo and branding incorporating eco friendly aspects of the business.
* Website update including the newest trends, more user friendly.
* Branded print materials update

I spent a lot of time researching big travel companies, trying to understand the process and how it works. 
I mostly focused on the eco aspect of the company., researched best materials for print and 
how to incorporated nature in the logo.

## The Idea:

The idea was to create a fresh and simple look associated with nature. My inspiration came from the landscapes of 
their destinations; that’s why I decided to include the movement of waves, the peaks of hills and animal symbols 
that would symbolise eco friendly tourism and agrotourism.

## The problem:

This was a project I was doing my internship that turned into my diploma at UCN. At this point it pretty much

## 2020 Update:

Looking at this project from today’s point of view, I would say there is some things that could have been 
improved. Website experience should have been tested but I didn’t had that knowledge or experience 
at the time. I still decided to use this project in my case studies, as it was one of my very first 
individual, big project that even to this day, still looks very modern and up to date.
