Eco-Tour is a travel agency that specialises in eco friendly tourism, agrotourism and everyday travel. They are 
selling transportation, accommodation, insurance and other organised travel services.

## The brief:

* Logo and branding incorporating eco friendly aspects of the business.
* Website update including the newest trends, more user friendly.
* Branded print materials update

## Research:

I spent a lot of time researching big travel companies, trying to understand the process and how it works. 
I mostly focused on the eco aspect of the company, researching the best materials for print, and 
how to incorporated nature into the logo.

## The Idea:

The idea was to create a fresh and simple look associated with nature. My inspiration came from the landscapes of 
their destinations; that’s why I decided to include the movement of waves, the peaks of hills, and animal symbols 
that would symbolise eco friendly tourism and agrotourism.

## The problem:

This was a project I was doing during my internship that turned into my diploma at UCN. At this point it pretty much 
came down to the cost of the re-brand, re-printing all the materials and hiring a developer to update the 
website - unfortunately the project was not used.

## Final result:

The logo is very minimalistic, yet captivating, and features all the nature elements I wanted to include. 
I decided to go with eco-friendly recycled paper for print materials. The original website did not include photography
of the destinations and I wanted to introduce this to make this visually engaging and to highlight the natural beauty
of the areas the company serviced.  There was previously no search engine available within the site, and I wanted to add 
this as a matter of urgency and designed the new site accordingly.

## 2020 Update:

Looking at this project from today’s point of view, I would say there is some things that could have been 
improved. The website experience should have been tested, but I didn’t have that knowledge or experience 
at the time. I still decided to use this project in my case studies, as it was one of my very first 
individual, and one of my biggest single projects. I think it still looks very modern and up to date.
