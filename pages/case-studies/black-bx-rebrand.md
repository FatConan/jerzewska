BLACKBX is a SaaS software company providing customer insights and effective
digital marketing automation tools through data collection from Wifi. The name
came from the black box, that was offering along side the software. BX was short
from the word BOX, but as there was existing company Black Box, they decided
to shorten it up.

## The brief:

Modern black “sexy” branding.
{maybe?

## Inspirations:

## Research:

I was researching something classy and “sexy” as my employer wanted. They were
a brand new startup and wanted to stand out from their competition. They didn’t
wanted to achieve cool and modern look. Most of the software companies tends
to look very techy, they wanted to avoid looking like their software is hard to use
and can be used by anyone.

## The Idea:

I wanted to focus on the name, where it came from and what symbolises. Since
the company collect data from wifi as a highlighter I decided to use color green,
to show connectivity. Green also symbolises fresh growth, and wealth. In this 
project it could also mean being more eco-friendly as using the software
eliminates a lot of print materials since a lot of your marketing campaigns can be
send over the data collected from the wifi.

## The problem

Too much dark, black background colour is something problematic to use in a
larger scale. Pure black with white can cause discomfort for the eye when users
read the text over an extended period of time, leading to eye strain. Altho, black
isn’t bad for all users. low vision users, who are sight impaired but not blind, tend
to read text better on high contrast modes. Later on we decided to adjust this by
adding white space to the print and digital informational materials that involved
a lot of text to improve readability.

We also decided using devices, doesn’t have much of a character, and we wanted
to show a bit more people, how they play very important part in collecting the
data.

## Final result

I was very satisfied with the final result. I had to work on a lot of illustrations, focus
on the details.

My favourite bit was designing the promotional cards. The idea was to laser cut
the shape of the wifi. Inside of the card posts were green, so when the card was
taken out, it showed wifi sign “getting online”.

## Update:

As the company got bigger, they decided to do a complete rebrand as the
company with the similar name adapted our color scheme and it was very hard
to explain to people we’re not the same company.
